I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science (CS) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu) co-advised by [Dr. Layne T. Watson](https://dac.cs.vt.edu/person/layne-t-watson-2/) in CS and [Dr. Yili Hong](https://www.apps.stat.vt.edu/hong) in Statistics. I work as part of the [VarSys research team](http://varsys.cs.vt.edu), applying mathematical models to the study of variability in computation. I plan to graduate in 2020 and my primary research area is computational science, specifically numerical analysis and approximation theory. My dissertation is on writing mathematical software that constructs piecewise quintic Hermite interpolating polynomials.

My personal research ambitions outside of my dissertation work focus on progress towards artificial general intelligence. My current line of work for this is centered about trying to automatically infer the structure of data in order to build very sample-efficient approximations.

Outside of Computer Science, I like to hike, run, ride motorcycles, and play music. I was originally trained in percussion / drum set for Jazz and I've taught myself some guitar and piano for fun on the side. As many others do, I enjoy trying to take pretty pictures in my free time. [These are some of my favorites](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0JGWZuqDpCayQ).
