I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu). I work as part of the [VarSys research team](http://varsys.cs.vt.edu), applying mathematical models to the study of variability in computation. I plan to graduate in 2020 and my primary research area is computational science, specifically numerical analysis and approximation theory.

My personal research ambitions outside of my dissertation work center around progress towards artificial general intelligence. My current line of work for this is centered about trying to automatically infer the structure of data in order to build very sample-efficient approximations.

I started learning guitar in the Fall of 2018, and am almost good enough to play in front of other people now. I played percussion and drum set for Jazz band in high school, and learned some piano for fun on the side. And as many others do, I enjoy trying to take pretty pictures in my free time. [These are some of my favorites](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0JGWZuqDpCayQ).
