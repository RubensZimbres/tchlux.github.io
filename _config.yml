description: >
  I work towards useful Artificial Intelligence by developing
  mathematical theory, writing high performance software, and
  rigorously testing the accuracy and quality (of theory and code) in
  application. I frequent tools from approximation theory, numerical
  analysis, and nonparametric statistics.
