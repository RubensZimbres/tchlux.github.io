I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu).  I work towards useful Artificial Intelligence by developing mathematical theory, writing high performance software, and rigorously testing the accuracy and quality (of theory and code) in application. I frequent tools from approximation theory, numerical analysis, and nonparametric statistics.
