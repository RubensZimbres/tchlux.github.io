#### Convergence Rate Evaluation of Derivative Free Optimization Techniques

*September, 2016* [[pdf](http://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/papers/tchlux-2016-MOD.pdf)] [[link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-51469-7_21)]

This paper presents a convergence rate comparison of five different derivative-free numerical optimization techniques across a set of 50 benchmark objective functions. Results suggest that Adaptive Memory Programming for constrained Global Optimization, and a variant of Simulated Annealing are two of the fastest-converging numerical optimization techniques in this set. Lastly, there is a mechanism for expanding the set of optimization algorithms provided.


#### Applications of Supervised Learning Techniques on Undergraduate Admissions Data 

*May, 2016* [[pdf](http://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/papers/tchlux-2016-ACM_Computing_Frontiers.pdf)] [[link](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2911717)]

We discuss the use of supervised learning techniques in predicting admission decisions and enrollment based on historical applicant data. We show that a classifier trained and validated on previous yearsâ€™ data can identify (1) applicants that the admissions office is likely to accept, and (2) those accepted students that are likely to enroll at the institution. Additionally, results from our feature selection experiments inform admissions offices of the significance of applicant features relative to acceptance and enrollment, thus aiding the office in future data collection and decision making.

#### Teaching Variability in a Core Systems Course (Abstract Only)

*February, 2018* [[link](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3162275)]]

This project emphasized teaching the effects (and prevalence) of computational performance variability to undergrads in a Computer Systems course. I (Thomas Lux) was involved in creating the visualization / analytics tool that the students in the course used to study the effects of variability in code that they wrote. While this is an abstract-only submission, it represents a nontrivial amount of time and effort spent creating effective & accessible visualizations that teach the concepts of variability.
