#### Novel Meshes for Multivariate Interpolation and Approximation

*March, 2018* [[pdf](http://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/papers/tchlux-2018-ACMSE.pdf)] [[link](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3190687)]

A rapid increase in the quantity of data available is allowing all fields of science to generate more accurate models of multivariate phenomena. Regression and interpolation become challenging when the dimension of data is large, especially while maintaining tractable computational complexity. This paper proposes three novel techniques for multivariate interpolation and regression that each have polynomial complexity with respect to number of instances (points) and number of attributes (dimension). Initial results suggest that these techniques are capable of effectively modeling multivariate phenomena while maintaining flexibility in different application domains.

#### Convergence Rate Evaluation of Derivative Free Optimization Techniques

*September, 2016* [[pdf](http://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/papers/tchlux-2016-MOD.pdf)] [[link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-51469-7_21)]

This paper presents a convergence rate comparison of five different derivative-free numerical optimization techniques across a set of 50 benchmark objective functions. Results suggest that Adaptive Memory Programming for constrained Global Optimization, and a variant of Simulated Annealing are two of the fastest-converging numerical optimization techniques in this set. Lastly, there is a mechanism for expanding the set of optimization algorithms provided.

#### Applications of Supervised Learning Techniques on Undergraduate Admissions Data 

*May, 2016* [[pdf](http://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/papers/tchlux-2016-ACM_Computing_Frontiers.pdf)] [[link](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2911717)]

We discuss the use of supervised learning techniques in predicting admission decisions and enrollment based on historical applicant data. We show that a classifier trained and validated on previous yearsâ€™ data can identify (1) applicants that the admissions office is likely to accept, and (2) those accepted students that are likely to enroll at the institution. Additionally, results from our feature selection experiments inform admissions offices of the significance of applicant features relative to acceptance and enrollment, thus aiding the office in future data collection and decision making.

#### A Polynomial Time Algorithm for Multivariate Interpolation in Arbitrary Dimension via the Delaunay Triangulation

*March, 2018* [[link](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3190645.3190680)]

The Delaunay triangulation is a fundamental construct from computational geometry, which finds wide use as a model for multivariate piecewise linear interpolation in fields such as geographic information systems, civil engineering, physics, and computer graphics. The computational complexity for constructing the complete Delaunay triangulation grows exponentially in higher dimensions. Therefore, usage of the Delaunay triangulation as a model for interpolation in high-dimensional domains remains computationally infeasible by standard methods. In this paper, a polynomial time algorithm is presented for interpolating at a finite set of points in arbitrary dimension via the Delaunay triangulation.

#### Teaching Variability in a Core Systems Course (Abstract Only)

*February, 2018* [[link](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3162275)]

This project emphasized teaching the effects (and prevalence) of computational performance variability to undergrads in a Computer Systems course. I (Thomas Lux) was involved in creating the visualization / analytics tool that the students in the course used to study the effects of variability in code that they wrote. While this is an abstract-only submission, it represents a nontrivial amount of time and effort spent creating effective & accessible visualizations that teach the concepts of variability.
