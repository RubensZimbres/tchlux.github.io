# Defining and Generating Well-Spaced Samples

- a random sample is enough, but how big are the gaps?
- random samples are "clustered" together
- a "latin design" is an easy way to solve this
- the biggest gap is to the corner, but the corner gets far away in high dimension
- the regular simplex has perfect spacing, so does a simplicial grid, but it doesn't pack nicely into the box
- lets use spheres instead! how do we get random points on spheres though?
- same problem with clustering as before, latin designs to the rescue again?
