# Titles Are Worth 1000

Including `code` inline looks alright. But what about formula?

<img class="formula" src="./formula-1.svg" title="testing a title"/>

That formula will make everything more clear, especially in the context of a visual.

<p class="visual">
<iframe src="https://tchlux.github.io/documents/nn-activations.html">
<p class="caption">Putting a caption under the image is something that can be done to describe what is happening in a clear way separate from the main body of the text.</p>

## Subheadings to the moon

And sometimes it's not clear. Opaque can be a good.
